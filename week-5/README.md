# Week 5 Input/Output demonstrations

In this directory there are a number of examples to demonstrate input and output in Python. Download them your working directory and try some of them out. There are descriptions within the source code and suggestions for exercises to train a little.

The main files can all be run using the `python` command. The files are:

	`main_cmd_line.py`: takes an extra command line argument with a value to factorize and print to the console.

	`main_input.py`: an interactive script that will halt and ask the user for input which is factorized and printed to the console

	`main_input_from_file.py`: reads data from a file and line by line factorizes the values and prints the result to console.

	`main_fwrite.py`: same as `main_input_from_file.py`, but it will write the results on separate lines in an output file.

Also try experimenting with including other functions from `mathfuncs.py` and working with them, and/or putting the file in a separate directory and making it into a module that you include instead.

Good luck!
