# python-course

Here you will find all the notebooks and material for the course.

## Python version

This course will be using Python 3. A recommended way of installing Python is using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) which comes with many packages pre-installed and is easy to setup on all platforms.

## Planning

 * week 3: Basic syntax, variables and functions.
 * week 4: Control flow.
 * week 5: Input/Output, modules, files, command line.
 * week 6: Lists, dictionaries, sets.
 * week 7: Classes and objects.
 * week 8: Object oriented programming.
 * week 9: Visualizing data.

## How to open the notebooks

### Host yourself

You are very welcome to clone this repository and install your Jupyter Notebook server to host the notebooks.

Instructions can be found at the [Jupyter Notebook homepage](https://jupyter.org/install).

During a later class I will demonstrate how to install it otherwise.


### Through Google Colab

Host a Jupyter server yourself may feel too advanced at first, and in that case Google offers a free hosting of the notebooks for you through their [Colab project](https://colab.research.google.com).

 * Go to the above link. You will be prompted with a dialog window that will ask you to open a notebook. Click on the github tab.

 * Copy the URL to the notebook from the github repository and insert into the search field and search. There should come up a result with the notebook that you can click on to open.

## Programing tools

Everyone has their taste. Some like it simple and do more things by themselves, others prefer an all-in-one solution that has a lot of builtin functionality. Here is a short list of IDEs and editors that are nice to use when working with Python (and other languages also):

 * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Nice IDE with a lot of features. It is a Microsoft product but I think it is available on all platforms.
 * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Editor with a lot extra features and with possibility for installing plugins to make it more like an IDE.
 * [Atom](https://atom.io/). Pretty much the same concept as Sublime Text.
 * [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). An IDE that focuses on a lot on scientific projects.
 * [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). A very versatile IDE with support for many languages and plugins.
